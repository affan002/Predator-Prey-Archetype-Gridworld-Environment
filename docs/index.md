A **discrete, grid-based multi-agent predator–prey environment** designed as a controlled research testbed for studying coordination, pursuit–evasion, and emergent behavior in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL).

## Overview

This framework provides a **discrete, grid-based simulation** designed to support controlled, interpretable, and reproducible experiments in MARL. It models classic predator-prey dynamics where multiple agents interact and learn in a bounded grid world.

Key goals:

* Facilitate **mechanistic understanding** of MARL behavior.
* Support **reproducible research** and ablation studies.
* Provide an **accessible learning tool** for students and new researchers.

## Features

### 🔍 Fully Interpretable
**State and action spaces are fully enumerable and transparent**, making it easy to track agent behavior, transitions, and environment evolution step-by-step.

### 🧩 Modular and Customizable
**Variables and reward structures can be modified in isolation**, enabling controlled experimentation. Easily change grid size, agent behavior, episode length, reward schemes, and terminal conditions.

### 🧪 Built for Rigorous Experimentation
**Reproducible ablation experiments** are supported by design. The codebase encourages transparency, logging, and clear interpretation of learning dynamics.

## Quick Start

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ProValarous/Predator-Prey-Archetype-Gridworld-Environment.git
cd Predator-Prey-Archetype-Gridworld-Environment
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Minimal Example
```python
from multi_agent_package.gridworld import GridWorldEnv
from multi_agent_package.agents import Agent

# Define agents (type, team, name)
predator = Agent("predator", "predator_1", "Hunter")
prey = Agent("prey", "prey_1", "Runner")

# Create environment
env = GridWorldEnv(
    agents=[predator, prey],
    size=8,
    render_mode="human"
)

# Run a single episode
obs, info = env.reset(seed=42)
done = False

while not done:
    actions = {
        "Hunter": env.action_space.sample(),
        "Runner": env.action_space.sample()
    }
    result = env.step(actions)
    done = result["done"]

env.close()
```
